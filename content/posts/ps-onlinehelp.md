TL;DR: [Online-Based Help Example](#example)

<!--Intro-->

## Help _but Online_

The `Get-Help` cmdlet in PowerShell is a handy tool, commonly used for obtaining details about commands and modules. Itâ€™s equally _helpful_ for user-written scripts and functions, serving as a structured way to document the Scope, Parameters, Examples, and any additional Notes.

There are three main ways to accomplish this: Comment-Based, XML-Based, and Online. In this Article, we will be going over Online-Based Help.

<!--Brief Overview-->

### Take me to your Leader

The ability to provide updated information to a group of users at the speed of light is the main upside to using Online `Get-Help`. There are a few good reasons why you'll want to take advantage of it:  

* Version Control: The information remains up-to-date and allows for easy tracking and management of changes.

* Collaboration: If the linked resource is a collaborative platform, such as a wiki or a discussion forum, users can contribute their knowledge and provide feedback.

Let's go over what that looks like with an example scenario.

#### Engage

In this function example, I've written a tiny function that changes the output of a Debian-based Linux distro's Debian Package Manager cmdlet `dpkg -l` into a PowerShell Object.

```powershell
Function Get-Packages {
        ((dpkg -l).split("ii")).Trimstart() | 
        Select-Object -Skip 6 | 
        ForEach-Object {$_ -replace '\s{2,}', ', '} | 
        ConvertFrom-Csv -Header Name, Version, Architecture, Description | 
        Select-Object -Property Name, Version, Architecture, Description
}
```

Now that I have my stellar function ready, let's start the documentation!

In my [XML-Based article](https://www.fordablescripts.com/posts/ps-xmlhelp/), we went over using the PlatyPS PowerShell Module to create a Template Markdown file. I'll be using that again here to make things a little easier.

First, I'll set the function in the terminal then use `new-markdownhelp`:

```powershell
PS /home/grumble> new-markdownhelp -command "Get-Packages" -outputfolder "/home/fordablscripts/Documents/Dev/fordablecontent/Help" -force
WARNING: [GetHelpFileName] Cannot find module for command 'Get-Packages'

    Directory: /home/fordablscripts/Documents/Dev/fordablecontent/Help

UnixMode         User       Group         LastWriteTime         Size Name
--------         ----       -----         -------------         ---- ----
-rw-r--r--       grumble    grumble      8/3/2024 10:15          559 Get-Packages.md
```

This creates a quick template where I can add the functions information. Here's a blank template:

~~~markdown

Using Github, I'll upload this `.md` file to the [Fordablescripts' Github PowerShell Repository](https://github.com/fordablescripts/PowerShell/blob/main/Help/Get-Packages.md), make the necessary tweaks and changes, and add the link to the page back into the function along with some basic help information.

##### Example

```powershell
Function Get-Packages {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    List installed packages for Debian-based Linux systems
    .DESCRIPTION
    Runs the Debian package manager (dpkg) and converts the output to a PowerShell Object.
    .LINK
    https://github.com/fordablescripts/PowerShell/blob/main/Help/Get-Packages.md
    .EXAMPLE
    Get-Installed | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "fire*"} | Select-Object -Property Name, Version | Format-List
    #>
        ((dpkg -l).split("ii")).Trimstart() | 
        Select-Object -Skip 6 | 
        ForEach-Object {$_ -replace '\s{2,}', ', '} | 
        ConvertFrom-Csv -Header Name, Version, Architecture, Description | 
        Select-Object -Property Name, Version, Architecture, Description
}
```

And just like that we have our Online-Based help article. With `Get-Help Get-Packages -Online`, users will be directed to my github page that will have the functions information along with any updated changes.

### Enlist in the PowerShell Community Today

This Article concludes my `Get-Help` series where I go over the differences and importance of using documentation for your PowerShell scripts. We've gone over Comment-Based Help[^1], XML-Based Help[^2], and finally Online-Based help with this Article. You can learn more about this topic over at [Microsoft's PowerShell Hub Site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/).

My last recommendation with this series and any that I write, is to become a member of the community.

For the PowerShell community, you can file issues, bugs, or feature requests over at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/powershell/powershell/issues) or in one of these public forums:
