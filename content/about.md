In 2016, I ventured into the realm of IT, where I’ve been diligently applying myself to master the craft. My initiation began in the trenches of customer service, where I learned the foundational spells of communication and problem-solving. With time, my journey led me to oversee IT infrastructure and guide system deployments, always with a steadfast commitment to enhancing the user experience.

My path has been marked by various IT challenges, from data migration to system virtualization, undertaken with the aim of preserving seamless operations and achieving user contentment. My interest in technology is rooted in a sincere desire to understand its evolving role in our lives.

Scripting is a discipline where I’ve found my niche, enabling me to refine processes, encourage automation, and improve efficiency. I share my learnings and discoveries on my blog, hoping to equip my fellow IT enthusiasts with practical insights and tools, contributing humbly to our collective knowledge.
